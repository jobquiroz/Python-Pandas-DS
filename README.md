# Python for Data Science (using the Numpy and Pandas libraries)

This repository contains information from several sources (mainly online courses) related to Python, Numpy and Pandas.
I decided to put some comments in Spanish because I think that by describing (relevant) python operations with my own words makes me realize whether or not I fully understand the concepts. 

It is divided into two folders: Python & Numpy and Pandas.

## Python & Numpy

### Coursera - [01 Coursera Python basics and Numpy](https://github.com/jobquiroz/Python-Pandas-DS/blob/master/Python%20%26%20Numpy/01%20Relevant%20Snipets.md)

Python notebook corresponding to week 1 from Introduction to Data Science by University of Michigan.

In this week we review some basic Python commands and a general tour for Numpy.

**Content**
 - **Python**
   - Python functions
   - Operations on numbers, lists and strings.
   - Dictionaries and ways to iterate them
   - The `.format()`method
   - Reading and writing CSV files
   - Dates and Times
   - Object classes and `map()`
 - **Numpy**
   - Creating arrays (shape, reshape, linspace, resize, ones, zeros, eye)
   - Combining arrays (vstack, hstack)
   - Element-wise operations (+, -, *, /, **)
   - Array operations (dot product, Transpose, casting)
   - Aggregation functions (sum, max, min,mean, std, argmax, argmin)
   - Indexing/slicing. 
   - Conditional indexing (fundamental of Pandas)
   - `.copy()` method.
   - Creating random arrays
   - Iterating over arrays
   - `zip` function.
