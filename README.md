# Python for Data Science (using the Numpy and Pandas libraries)

This repository contains information from several sources (mainly online courses) related to Python, Numpy and Pandas.
I decided to put some comments in Spanish because I think that by describing (relevant) python operations with my own words makes me realize whether or not I fully understand the concepts. 

It is divided into two folders: Python & Numpy and Pandas.
