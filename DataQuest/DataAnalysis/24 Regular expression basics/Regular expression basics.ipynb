    "As powerful as regular expressions are, they can be difficult to learn at first and the syntax can look visually intimidating. As a result, a lot of students end up disliking regular expressions and try to avoid using them, instead opting to write more cumbersome code.\n",

    "- Regular expressions are often faster to execute than their manual equivalents.\n",

The most important thing is to **understand the core principles**, what is possible, and where to look up the details. This will mean you can quickly jog your memory whenever you need regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, don't be put off if some things in these missions don't stick in your memory. As long as you are able to write and understand regular expressions with the help of documentation and/or other reference guides, you have all the skills you need to excel.\n",

Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles; stories that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors.\n",

    "The dataset we will be working with is based off this CSV of Hacker News stories from September 2015 to September 2016. The columns in the dataset are explained below:\n",

    "- num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the story\n",
    "- author: The username of the person who submitted the story\n",
    "- created_at: The date and time at which the story was submitted\n",

    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've been using sets like [Pp] to match different capitalizations in our regular expressions. This strategy works well when there is only one character that has capitalization, but becomes cumbersome when we need to cater for multiple instances.\n",

    "Within the titles, there are many different formatting styles used to represent the word \"email.\" Here is a list of the variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "EMAIL\n",
    "emails\n",
    "Emails\n",
    "E-Mails\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a regular expression for this, we would need to use a set for all five letters in email, which would make our regular expression very hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use **flags** to specify that our regular expression should ignore case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both re.search() and the pandas regular expression methods accept an optional flags argument. This argument accepts one or more flags, which are special variables in the re module that modify the behavior of the regex interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of all available flags is in the documentation, but by far the most common and the most useful is the `re.IGNORECASE` flag, which is also available using the alias `re.I` for convenience.\n",
